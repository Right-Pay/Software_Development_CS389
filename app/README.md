This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios

#Make sure iOS device is on same network as computer
#Shake the screen and click Confugure Bundler and then enter computers ip address
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?

- If you want to add this new React Native code to an existing application, check out the [Integration guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps).
- If you're curious to learn more about React Native, check out the [Introduction to React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).

# Troubleshooting

If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) page.

- If you can not launch the android emulator, run this:

```
npx react-native doctor
```

- If there are any issues with the android sdk, edit your config file for the emulator of your choice to use host graphics:
```
C:/Users/<user>/.android/AVD/<your emulator name>.avd/config.init

gpu.mode=host
```

- Some commands to try

When the app fails on Task: app:installDebug
```
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npm cache clean --force
```

```
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

When the install hangs on install app-debug.apk do this:
```
adb kill-server
adb start-server
```

When
```
Gradle could not start your build.
> Cannot create service of type BuildSessionActionExecutor using method LauncherServices$ToolingBuildSessionScopeServices.createActionExecutor() as there is a problem with parameter #21 of type FileSystemWatchingInformation.
```
Do this
```
WMIC PROCESS where "Name like 'java%' AND CommandLine like '%GradleDaemon%'" Call Terminate
```

- You can also wipe the emulator
